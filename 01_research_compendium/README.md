# Markup languages and reproducible programming in statistics

Deliverable 1: Reproducible research compendium.

This research compendium belongs to my thesis project (Research Report). It reproduces Figure 2 from the report, which shows results from simulated data. The Research Report itself is submitted separately as the formatted manuscript.

By default, `11_MASTER_SCRIPT.R` runs a small and computationally inexpensive simulation for testing. To reproduce the exact results reported in the manuscript, run the commented-out simulation call in `11_MASTER_SCRIPT.R` (lines 99–124).
