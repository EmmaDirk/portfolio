## Introduction

We will act as though we have very useful things to say about simulation studies here. In fact, so useful that we even include an equation, which shows just how useful equations are:

$$
U = \frac{N_E^2}{F},
$$

where $U$ is usefulness, $N_E$ is the number of equations, and $F$ is the amount of effort expended. I think we are now ready to move on to our results! Methods are overrated anyway.

## Results

Here are some results from our simulation study:
```{r results}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Effect of measurement error on the HbA1C estimate"

# loading the here package
if (!require(here)) {
  install.packages("here")
}
library(here)

# getting the packages we need
source(here::here("scripts", "00_packages.R"))

# loading the data
# we try to avaid cluttering the console with messages/warnings
invisible(
  capture.output(
    suppressMessages(
      suppressWarnings(
        source(here::here("scripts", "01_loading_data.R"),
               local = .GlobalEnv)
      )
    ),
    type = c("output", "message")
  )
)

# data preparation
source(here::here("scripts", "02_data_preparation.R"))

# optional: analysis of the original data
# source(here::here("scripts", "03_data_preparation.R"))

# simulation study results
source(here::here("scripts", "04_sim_MSE.R"))

# creating the plot
