# Markup languages and reproducible programming in statistics

Deliverable 2: Formatted markup manuscript.

This manuscript is the Research Report from my thesis project. Figure 2 in this manuscript can be reproduced using the research compendium. The figures are also provided as .png files so the manuscript can be read without running the (computationally expensive) simulation code.
